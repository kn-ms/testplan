Introduced ``dependencies`` parameter to :py:class:`Test <testplan.testing.base.Test>` and thus :py:class:`MultiTest <testplan.testing.multitest.MultiTest>`. User can now define driver start-up dependencies as a directed graph and achieve better parallel start-up schedule and less environment start-up time. Please check :ref:`documentation <multitest_drivers>` and :ref:`example <example_driver_dependency>` for more details.
